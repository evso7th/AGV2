# **App Name**: MathTune Box

## Core Features:

- Algorithmic Music Generation: Generate music algorithmically using mathematical functions and parameters. Implement customizable controls for users to adjust musical scales, tempo, and instrument choices.
- Interactive Controls: Provide interactive sliders and input fields that allow users to modify the parameters that will feed the music generation algorithms.
- Playback Interface: Allow playback/pause/stop for the music.
- Parameter Presets: Allow storing different combinations of music generation parameters into named presets for easy re-use.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#34495E) to create a contemplative, focused mood conducive to mathematical exploration and musical experimentation.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#222F3D), nearly black, provides high contrast for interface elements.
- Accent color: Cyan (#4AC0C0), slightly more saturated than the other colors, provides highlights on interactive elements and visual feedback.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif for a techy, precise look; use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer descriptions.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons for controls, parameters, and settings.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with clear separation between controls and the output.
- Subtle animations to visualize musical parameters.
